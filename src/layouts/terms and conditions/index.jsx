              It is the traveler’s responsibility to protect their purchases.
              For this reason, Travel Protection Coverage including additional

              Our Suppliers are, unfortunately, unable to offer additional
              assistance to travelers with limited mobility and all such
              assistance will need to be provided by whoever the traveler is
              traveling with. Travelers with disabilities must notify Group
              Getaways at the time of booking of status and of the identity of
              their non-discounted, paid travel companion who will be
              responsible for providing all necessary assistance. We may request
              that you provide a letter from your doctor confirming your fitness
              to travel.
